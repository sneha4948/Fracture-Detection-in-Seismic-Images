# Fracture Detection in Seismic Images
- Fracture/Fault detection from seismic images is an integral task both for geoscience research and industries involved in oil extraction.
  
- Present detection technique involve tremendous task of printing inline seismic data on large sheets and raw observation across pixel columns on the sheet.
  
- Large number of workforce is required for faster detection.
  
- High Human error
  
This results in significant cost of resources and time to identity faults. Present development in the field of deep learning and image segmentation have opened possibilities of segmenting fault layers. This project discusses a model to detect and present fault/fracture layer using deep learning techniques.
